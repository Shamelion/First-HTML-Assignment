      <p>
        I've done so many jobs over the years but ill only name a few; sales rep, bricklaying, petrol station attendant among others. <br>
        I also had the opportunity to enroll at <strong>Ultimate Computer Center</strong> to learn about the Computer, creating word documents, excel sheet, among other computer functions. <br>
        There and then my love for computer was growing one step at a time.

      </p>

      <h2>Achivements and Milestones</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years ive been able to record a good success so to say even tho it was really a tough journey but all thanks to God the most high and my family that has always been there to encourage me.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies and Interest</h2>
      <p>
        I love to watch movies (scientific, adventure and action). <br>
        Engaging in healty conversations (it helps me learn faster). <br>
        I'm also an outdoor person (i cant stay indoor for too long because it gets really boring and makes me sick). <br>
        I play indoor games like; scrabble, whot, draft, ludo, opon ayo (a yoruba traditional game) and mobile games (anyone i find investing).

      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        I hope in the future i can get to look back 5 years or more and see how much of a positive difference i've been able to make to the tech world at large and my immediate society. <br>
        I'm really hoping i can get to have a company of my own that'll be well recognised in the society for creating jobs for those that needs it (controlling joblessness amongs youth) and solving world problems using technology.

      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        So far so good my life's journey has really been tough and more of a training ground for whats to come. <br>
        I'm aspiring to become a senior developer and most likly a fullstack developer. <br>
        Thanks to Alt School Africa for giving me the opportunity to be able to explore the tech world and have a taste of its sweetness even tho its not gonna be an easy journey but my determination will keep me going.
      </p>
        <p>May the force be with me. <br>So help me God.</p>
